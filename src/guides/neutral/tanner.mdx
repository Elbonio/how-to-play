# Tanner

The Tanner is a neutral player. They hate their job and they want out.
The Tanner wins the game by getting lynched. If they are lynched, the
game immediately ends.

## Role Type

  - The Tanner is seen as a Neutral Party by the Seer.
  - The Tanner is not seen as a user of witchcraft.
  - The Tanner does not have a night action so will not be seen visiting
    by the Harlot/Stalker/Familiar.
  - The Tanner is not seen as a killer by the Adjudicator.

## Notes on the Tanner

  - The Tanner only wins if they are lynched, being killed at night does
    not count.
  - The Tanner cannot be recruited by sub-faction leaders (Mason,
    Inquisition, Illuminati). However, they can be recruited by a
    Vampire or Vampire Master.
  - The Tanner is only used in Speed Games.

## Tips for playing Tanner

  - Tanners are a danger to the wolves as well as the village. Don't
    rely on the wolves being happy to bandwagon a vote against you if
    you are too obvious.
